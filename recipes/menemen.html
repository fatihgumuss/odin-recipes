        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Turkish-inspired egg dish is very similar to the way some Mexican egg 
            breakfasts are prepared. Very versatile and you can control the level of spiciness.</p>

            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced red bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced Aleppo chiles, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped tomato</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 large eggs,beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon thinly sliced basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon crumbled feta cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
